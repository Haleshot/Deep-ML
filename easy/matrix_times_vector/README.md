## Problem Statement

Write a Python function that takes the dot product of a matrix and a vector. Return -1 if the matrix could not be dotted with the vector.

## Example

```python
input: a = [[1,2],[2,4]], b = [1,2]
output: [5, 10]
reasoning: 1*1 + 2*2 = 5
           1*2 + 2*4 = 10
```

## Learn: Matrix Times Vector

Consider a matrix $A$ and a vector $v$, where:

Matrix $A$:

$$
A = \begin{pmatrix}
a_{11} & a_{12} \\
a_{21} & a_{22}
\end{pmatrix}
$$

Vector $v$:

$$
v = \begin{pmatrix}
v_1 \\
v_2
\end{pmatrix}
$$

The dot product of $A$ and $v$ results in a new vector:

$$
A \cdot v = \begin{pmatrix}
a_{11}v_1 + a_{12}v_2 \\
a_{21}v_1 + a_{22}v_2
\end{pmatrix}
$$

## Things to Note

An $m \times n$ matrix will need to be multiplied by a vector of size $n$ or else this will not work.

## Solution

```python
def matrix_dot_vector(a, b):
    if len(a) == len(b):
        l = []
        for i in a:
            l.append(sum([j*k for j,k in zip(i,b)]))
        return l
    return -1
```

## Code Explanation

The function `matrix_dot_vector` takes two parameters:
- `a`: a 2D list representing the matrix
- `b`: a 1D list representing the vector

The function attempts to compute the dot product of the matrix and vector:

1. The condition `if len(a) == len(b):` checks if the number of rows in the matrix equals the length of the vector. This isn't the standard condition for matrix-vector multiplication, but it does ensure that the resulting vector will have the same number of elements as the input vector.

2. If the dimensions are compatible, it computes the dot product:
   - It iterates through each row of the matrix.
   - For each row, it computes the sum of element-wise products with the vector using a list comprehension and the `zip` function.
   - The result is appended to a list `l`.
   - Finally, it returns the list `l` containing the dot product results.

3. If the dimensions are not compatible, it returns -1.

Note: This implementation will work correctly for square matrices where the number of rows equals the number of columns. In this case, checking `len(a) == len(b)` is equivalent to checking if the number of columns in the matrix equals the length of the vector.

For non-square matrices, this implementation will still produce a result, but it may not be the conventional matrix-vector product. It will compute a result vector with the same number of elements as the input vector, using as many elements from each row of the matrix as there are in the vector.

For a more robust implementation, you might want to check if the number of columns in the matrix matches the length of the vector, which is the standard requirement for matrix-vector multiplication.
